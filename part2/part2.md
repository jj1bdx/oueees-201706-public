# Some thoughts on Part 1 report answers

* **You can program or write code**
* Sharing requires synchronization
* Social sharing is another issue
* *Reusing* software is not sharing
* **Decoupling is hard**

# Is cloud really a uniform and single entity?

---

![original fit](Cloud_Computing-slide.jpg)

# Absolutely not: it's an intertwined *network* of computers

# Web services are clusters of computers and networks

**Thousands or millions of servers connected together**

**A physical server is separated into multiple virtual machines**

# Example of networks connecting multiple nodes

# Centralized network

All nodes are connected to the single core

One hop to the core

Two hops between non-core nodes

No communication path between the nodes if the core fails

---

![right fit](network-decentralized.png)

# Decentralized network

A few nodes are connected to the core

Some nodes are connected to local concentrated nodes

Hierarchical structure

---

![right fit](network-distributed.png)

# Distributed network

No core exists anymore

No hierarchical structure

Multiple redundant paths are available between two nodes

Many hops are required to reach between two nodes

# [fit] Partition tolerance

## Distributed systems should not stop working even if netsplit occurs

---

# [fit] Consistency
# .vs.
# [fit] Availability

---

# Data store requirements[^1]

**Consistency: all clients get responses to requests that make sense**

**Availability: all operations eventually return successfully**

**Partition Tolerance: system works even under network split**

[^1]: [CAP Confusion: Problems with 'partition tolerance', Cloudera Engineering Blog](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2010/04/cap-confusion-problems-with-partition-tolerance/)

---

# Partition happens

**Consistent under partition: resynchronize after partition ends** (unavailable before synchronization)

**Available under partition: data between partitioned subsystems will be inconsistent** (consistency to be recovered when partition ends)

... **mutually conflicting**

---

# If consistency and availability are both required, then...

**Consistent and available system should not include networks within**

(In large-scale systems this kind of assumption is practically not feasible)

# [fit] Concurrency

## Real world is concurrent

### Actions independently happen
### No strict synchronization
### Actions simultaneously happen

---

![fit](locking.jpg)

---

# False assumptions on concurrent programming

* **Sequences are preserved**
* **Sequences are predictable**
* **All data are available before a time limit**
* **All operations complete before a time limit**
* **All functions are operational at any time**
* ... and more issues not described here

---

# Implications

* **Distributed systems are mutually dependent with each other**
* **A node failure may cause a total system failure at once if badly designed**
* **Concurrency is hard**
* **Satisfying consistency and availability is even harder**
