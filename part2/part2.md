# Centralized network

All nodes are connected to the single core

One hop to the core

Two hops between non-core nodes

No communication path between the nodes if the core fails

---

![right fit](network-decentralized.png)

# Decentralized network

A few nodes are connected to the core

Some nodes are connected to local concentrated nodes

Hierarchical structure

---

![right fit](network-distributed.png)

# Distributed network

No core exists anymore

No hierarchical structure

Multiple redundant paths are available between two nodes
